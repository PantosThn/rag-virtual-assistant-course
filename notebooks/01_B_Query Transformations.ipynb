      " As of the latest data available, Greek inflation has been influenced by a combination of domestic and international factors. In recent years, Greece, like many other European countries, has experienced fluctuations in inflation rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact, supply chain disruptions, and energy price volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2022, Greece saw a significant rise in inflation, driven primarily by increased energy costs and supply chain issues. The war in Ukraine further exacerbated these pressures, leading to higher prices for natural gas and oil, which are critical imports for Greece. This situation was compounded by the global supply chain disruptions that affected the availability and cost of goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Greek government and the European Central Bank (ECB) have been actively monitoring the situation. The ECB's monetary policy, including interest rate adjustments, aims to stabilize inflation across the Eurozone, which includes Greece. Additionally, the Greek government has implemented measures to mitigate the impact on consumers, such as subsidies for energy costs and targeted financial support for vulnerable households.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking forward, inflation in Greece is expected to gradually stabilize as global supply chains recover and energy markets adjust. However, the situation remains dynamic, and external factors such as geopolitical tensions and global economic trends will continue to play a significant role in shaping inflationary pressures in Greece. The government's ongoing efforts to strengthen the economy and diversify energy sources are crucial for long-term stability and resilience against future inflationary shocks.\n",

It is expected to decline to 3.0% in 2024, 2.4% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. Inflation excluding energy and food is forecast to remain higher, at 3.4% in 2024, 2.7% in 2025, and 2.0% in 2026. Headline inflation is expected to resume its decline in the last quarter of 2024, although wage pressures and minimum wage increases may exert upward pressure on prices.\n"
